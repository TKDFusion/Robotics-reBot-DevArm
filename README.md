## 📖 Introduction

**reBot-DevArm** is a robotic arm project dedicated to lowering the barrier to learning Embodied AI. We focus on **"True Open Source"** — not just the code, we unreservedly open source everything:

- 🛠️ **Hardware Blueprints**: Source files for sheet metal parts and 3D printed parts.
- 🔩 **BOM List**: Detailed down to the specifications and purchase links for every single screw.
- 💻 **Software & Algorithms**: Python SDK, ROS1/2, Isaac Sim, LeRobot, etc.

**⚠️ Note: This project is intended to promote education and personal learning. All resources are completely free for individual developers, students, and educational institutions. However, any unauthorized commercial use (including but not limited to selling kits directly or using it as part of a commercial product) is strictly prohibited.**

## 🗺️ Roadmap & Status

We are committed to continuously maintaining and adapting to mainstream robot development ecosystems. Below is our current adaptation progress and planned release schedule:
